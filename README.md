# Sensor System Gateway Project

This is a USB-based device that is accessed via a serial terminal (Putty etc). Commands are issued via the interface and are transmitted using LoRa to the Sensor System. Data is received back from the Sensor System.

The companion project is located here: https://github.com/sausagejohnson/Sensor-System

It is based on the STM32. 

Code is in C.
